# Dating And Drinking

## Project Highlights

- Interactive Tableau Dashboard: The centerpiece of this project is an interactive Tableau dashboard that goes beyond mere data visualization. It invites users to engage with the data, uncover patterns, and draw their conclusions in an intuitive and user-friendly environment.

- Innovative Use of Butterfly Chart: The dashboard employs a butterfly chart, utilizing a dichromatic color scheme—blue for men and red for women—to effectively compare and contrast drink preferences across genders. This choice of visualization facilitates a straightforward and visually appealing comparative analysis.
